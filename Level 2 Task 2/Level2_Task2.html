                    Albert Einstein, a German-born theoretical physicist, made significant contributions to the field of
                    physics, particularly with his development of the theory of relativity, which is considered one of
                    the fundamental pillars of modern physics. His most famous equation, E = mc², describes the
                    relationship between mass and energy and has gained worldwide recognition.

                    Einstein was born in the German Empire but later moved to Switzerland in 1895, giving up his German
                    citizenship. At the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program
                    at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich, where he graduated in 1900. In 1901, he acquired
                    Swiss citizenship, which he maintained throughout his life.

                    In 1903, Einstein secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. During his time
                    there, he continued to pursue his scientific interests and made significant advancements in
                    theoretical physics. In 1905, he received a Ph.D. from the University of Zurich for his
                    groundbreaking work on the photoelectric effect, which laid the foundation for quantum theory.

                    In 1914, Einstein relocated to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt
                    University of Berlin. It was during this time that he became the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm
                    Institute for Physics. He also regained German citizenship, this time as a Prussian citizen.

                    Albert Einstein's contributions to physics revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and
                    energy. His work on the theory of relativity has had a profound impact on various scientific
                    disciplines and continues to shape our modern understanding of the universe.

                <h2>Life and career</h2>
                <p>
                    Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, a city located in the Kingdom of Württemberg in
                    the German Empire. He came from a family of secular Ashkenazi Jews. His father, Hermann Einstein,
                    worked as a salesman and engineer, while his mother was named Pauline Koch.

                <p>
                    In 1880, when Albert was just one year old, his family moved to Munich. There, his father and uncle
                    Jakob established a company called Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, which specialized in
                    manufacturing electrical equipment based on direct current.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Albert began his education at a Catholic elementary school in Munich when he was five years old. He
                    attended this school for three years before being transferred to the Luitpold-Gymnasium, which is
                    now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium. At the Luitpold-Gymnasium, he received a comprehensive
                    primary and secondary education until he left the German Empire seven years later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These early experiences and challenges shaped Albert Einstein's educational journey and influenced
                    his perspective on traditional schooling methods. They also served as a catalyst for his independent
                    and innovative thinking, which would eventually lead him to make groundbreaking contributions to the
                    field of physics.
